<h2> <u>What is Medical Chatbots?</h2> </u> 

A chatbot is a piece of software that conducts a conversation with users via auditory or textual methods. A medical chatbot facilitates the job of a healthcare provider and helps improve their performance by interacting with users in a human-like way. 

There are countless cases where intelligent medical chatbots could help physicians, nurses, therapists, patients, or their families. They can step in and minimize the amount of time they spend on tasks like:
<ul>
    <li>Providing health-related information to users</li>
    <li>Guidance for patient</li>
    <li>Medication management and dosage</li>
    <li>Connecting people and organizations with first responders</li>
  </ul>
  
  It’s important to note that despite the fact that chatbots can offer valuable facts and symptoms, they aren’t qualified to give an official diagnosis. The main premise behind these talking or texting smart algorithms is to become the first point of contact before any human involvement is needed.

<h2> <u> How Medical Chatbots Can Improve Healthcare Services? </h2> </u>
All healthcare providers are always willing to help their patients, but the overwhelming workload doesn’t always let them provide the best service. A 21st medical practice can rely on a chatbot to ensure 24/7 availability, answer repetitive questions, or schedule appointments. What else can medical chatbots offer to the industry?
<ul>
<li>Immediate access to care – A chatbot quickly connects you with the right specialist and alerts the care teams of urgent changes in patients and emergencies. </li>
<li>Health monitoring and additional information – Patients need more than urgent medical attention. So, ongoing, post-discharge care can be virtually assisted by a bot. </li>
<li>Easy-to-use for doctors and patients – Conversational interfaces are very accessible and don’t have the complexities and learning curve typically associated with new technology. </li>
<li>Scalability – With technology, healthcare companies can deliver customer service without requiring additional resources (like human staff). </li>
<li>Convenient for a mobile-first consumer base – Mobile phones are one of the preferred methods of communication with brands, especially for certain demographics. Medical institutes can cater to that audience. </li>
<li>Improved patient satisfaction – These applications help overcome staff shortages with robotic assistance. No issue will be left unattended. </li>
</ul>

<h2><u>Concerns about Medical Chatbots!</h2></u>
Meanwhile, there are three important points you want to address and reassure your future users about:
<ul>
<li>Effectiveness – Make sure you can deliver a useful healthcare service or product and not a database overloaded with hundreds of ads and pop-up windows. </li>
<li>User privacy – Build a service that can withstand system errors and cyber-attacks. Plus, inform your users of the exact measures you’re taking to protect their personal data.</li>
<li>Trustworthiness – Online health services have gained a bad reputation after people started googling their symptoms and receiving terrifying diagnosis. So, you will need to prove your medical expertise.</li>
</ul>
